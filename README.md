# Overwatch: Iron Banner
This gamemode is an Overwatch Workshop port of Destiny's Iron Banner gamemode. The gamemode is currently in development.

## Gameplay
Two teams fight to control 3 zones and earn kills. Fully capturing a zone yields 1 point, and kills have a base value of 1 point. However, the more zones a team controls, the more valuable each kill is. Should a team capture all 3 zones, the Hunt will trigger. During the Hunt, all zones are locked, freeing the advantaged team to chase down kills. First team to reach 200 points wins!
