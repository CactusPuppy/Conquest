Gameplay
--------
Two teams fight to control 3 zones and earn kills. Fully capturing a zone yields 1 point, and kills have a base value of 1 point. However, the more zones a team controls, the more valuable each kill is. Should a team capture all 3 zones, the Hunt will trigger. During the Hunt, all zones are locked, freeing the advantaged team to chase down kills. First team to reach 100 points wins!

Installation
----------
The `lobby.owcs` contains custom game settings that can be copied and pasted into a Custom Game by the custom game owner by doing the following:
- Copy the contents of `lobby.owcs`
- Open the Settings of the custom game
- Click the orange paste icon

Alternatively, the latest Workshop code can be found [at this link](https://workshop.elohell.gg/eVXlsY0jGbWZfbg/Iron+Banner/)

*Note: `lobby.owcs` is the latest compiled version of the `master` branch.*
